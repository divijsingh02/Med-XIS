# Medical explainable Image Segmentation (Med-XIS)

This repository includes code for training medical image segmentation model along with its interpretations

Model used is Deeplabv3plus+resnet101

Interpretability Methods:

I.   Counterfactual attribute-based Interpretation

II.  Feature Differences

III. Bounding box comparision (Own)

Link for paper consisting explanations of how the model was trained, the data that was used, and interpretation of a model's predictions.
